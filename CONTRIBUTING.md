# Guidelines
## Rules
There's not many rules. Above all be nice, and treat others with respect. There
 are bound to be things others may not agree upon, seeing as I'm relatively new
 to C++, arduino, etc. If there's something you disagree with or if you have
 constructive feedback, I'm all ears! Just be civil about it :)
## General
Primarily this is a personal project, at least it began as such.

However, if you like what you see or want to copy/paste any code for your own 
idea, feel free!

The entire project is mostly planned as a fun learning experience with micro
processors, C++ and embedded systems in general. This is a light hearted project 
with no real or serious end goal for the time being.

It's somewhat linked to
 <getBeer href="https://github.com/NeonSpork/getBeer.git">getBeer</getBeer>, 
 another small project that uses a RaspberryPi, a touch screen and some smaller
 parts, and an old refrigerator to make a kegerator / kick-ass beer dispenser.

Similarly, if there's something glaring that you feel needs changing, feel free
 to submit a pull request.
## Where we're at
This project is currently in its infancy. The plan is that this will become a
 self contained embedded device eventually. But we'll see where the future leads.

## Future
Eventually as more features are added the project will evolve into something
 cool that might be interesting for other people to plug into their own micro
 processors, and build their own brewing systems.
